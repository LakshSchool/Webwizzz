Hackathon Challenge: Build an interactive, travel-themed web application that lets users explore any country in the world. When a user searches for or selects a country, your app should display useful and engaging information such as weather updates, country facts, and beautiful images.

Use public APIs like:

- REST Countries – for country details (flag, population, languages, etc.)

- OpenWeatherMap – for real-time weather data

- Unsplash (or similar) – for high-quality country-related images

Or use any other APIs.

Note: Bring your API keys beforehand to save time during the event. No extra time will be provided if you search for them during the event.

Your goal is to make the experience fun, informative, and visually appealing. Add animations, clean layouts, or maps—anything that enhances interactivity and user engagement.

Extra features are always welcome
Extra marks would be applauded if suitable.
